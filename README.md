This thesis investigates the effect of ultrasound on microbial inactivation and chemical reaction kinetics. Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli were exposed to 36 kHz ultrasound for varying durations, showing increased bacterial kill with longer sonication times—complete Bacillus inactivation in 6 min and ~99.9% E. coli removal in 90 min. Ultrasound’s lethality is attributed to cavitation, generating heat, pressure, and free radicals. For sonochemistry, ultrasonic velocity changes in Aniline–Ethyl acetate mixtures at 30 °C were measured to determine first-order reaction rate constants, which increased with Aniline concentration. The study concludes ultrasound is effective for bacterial deactivation and useful for studying reaction kinetics in liquid mixtures.
